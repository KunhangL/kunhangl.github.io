I start a part-time RA position working on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with Prof. [Shuhei Kurita](https://shuheikurita.github.io) at [National Institute of Informatics (NII LLMC)](https://llmc.nii.ac.jp)! Looking forward to bridging my experience in multimodality and NLP back to my bachelor major (robotics)~
